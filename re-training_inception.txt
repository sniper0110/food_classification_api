To re-train inception model, we use the following script inside tensorflowâ€™s docker image:


python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks \
--model_dir=/tf_files/inception \
--output_graph=/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
--output_labels=/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
--image_dir /tf_files/flower_photos



# tf_files : a folder containing a folder called flower_photos that has the food images
#            inside, this folder is where the generated files from retraining will be 
#            saved.
# inception : the trained model from google (the one we are going to re-train).
# bottlenecks : represents the nodes of the inception layer right before the last 
#               (softmax) layer, it will be re-computed when we retrain inception.
# retrain.py : is the python script used by tensorflow to retrain inception.  
# retrained_graph.pb : the retrained graph.
# retrained_labels.txt : a text file containing the labels of the different 11 categories of
# food.
